<p>	As an Information Science student, it is to my attention the amount of data that is collected on the daily. While this has become a pressing issue within the ethics of certain apps, organizations, websites, etc., it must also be taken into account the responsibilities these platforms have in order to protect their users. Many platforms have faced lawsuits and backlash from their lack of protection to their users, but on the same token, some platforms take action on behalf of their users, locking them out of said platforms. For example, organizations that have been found to do this include banks, Apple, and Robinhood. Our data is unveiled in the Internet, and these certain operations have come to consensus to put a stop to this for their user’s own good. Whether or not this is ethical, is subjective by case.

	From experience, I have been locked out of my own bank account several times. Not because of lack of trying or forgetting my password, but in the sense that my password was not “strong enough”. Just a couple weeks ago at the start of the New Year, my bank required all passwords to now include a special character. Not knowing this, I tried logging into my account with my old password and was denied access. The bank changed my account on their end without even contacting me or letting me know. While this is an example of this certain organization protecting me on my own behalf, it comes into question as a Information Science student if that change of data is my decision to make, or my banks.

	Another form of a platform taking matters into their own hands is when Apple locks a user out of their phone and disables their phone for using an incorrect password numerous times in a row. In this case, I believe that the platform’s use of responsibility for its user is put to good use. Opposite from the example at the bank, the phone’s password was not changed without notice, but was rather typed incorrectly numerous times causing Apple to release a lock on the phone for the better of the user. No data in this instance was changed without the user’s notice, so I trust Apple used their authority for the right matter. 
</p>
<p>	
	To illustrate even further, the platform Robinhood participated in this same sort of activity. Robinhood, an online stock brokerage platform, restricted their users on making popular investments as the stock market was imploding this past week. Robinhood, much like the previous platforms did, took initiative by restricting users to trade those particular stocks. As users got angry from this limitation, Robinhood used their jurisdiction to prevent stock traders from investing in wages that might detriment them in the future. Robinhood did not allow autonomy for their users to make their own decisions, however, based upon what was happening in the stock market, I believe Robinhood made the correct call in order to protect their users.
</p>

	All these platforms underwent a certain protocol to determine their customer’s usage, as which they thought was the correct responsibility and choice. Although banks, Apple, and Robinhood all carry different operations, one aspect in common is that they have the ability to secure their users from their data being unveiled to the world. Whether or not people agree with the decisions these platforms make for their users, in most occasions, it is beneficial.
