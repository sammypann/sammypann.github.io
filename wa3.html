<h1> Who's Responsible? </h1>
</body>

<p>	As an Information Science student, the debate revolving data is an everyday conversation. The question that comes into play always circles back to the idea of <i>who</i> should really be in charge of a user's information. Many individual users feel they should have the autonomy to lock themselves in and out of accounts, while platforms believe they should have control to protect their customers. Certain platforms and organzations such as local banks, Apple, and Robinhood have taken these types of measures for the security of the individual. Based on the easy accessibility of hacking data in this day and age, the authority that platforms have to protect users, even from themselevs, is completely ethical.  </p> 

<p>	From experience, I have been locked out of my own bank account several times. Not because of lack of trying or forgetting my password, but because my particular bank put a lock on all accounts. This is a reoccuring issue people experience through banking. An article on <i>KomoNews</i> wrote about this very issue how people were frightening by their frozen accounts. The article ensured users of their safety by stating, <q>The surge in lockout complaints appears to be tied to the massive unemployment fraud investigation, where criminals stole millions in benefits using stolen ID. It's a nationwide problem</q> (News 2020). It is only natural for users to get worried when their account is locked, but as exibitied by <i>KomoNews</i>, it most likely in order to proect thir customers from a greater threat. In this particular case, there was a major security breach that the bank wanted to protect their customers from. Individual users did not have the authority to lock their accounts, in event they did not know this breach was occurring. The bank made the right decision to secure their user's information, which is entirely principled. </p>

<p>	Another form of a platform intervening is when Apple locks a user out of their phone and disables their accounts for using an incorrect password numerous times in a row. Again, I believe that Apple's use of responsibility for its user is effective. While this may be an annoyance at times, all in all it is in the best interest for Apple customers. On Apple's official wesbite they wrote,<q>If you or someone else enters your password, security questions, or other account information incorrectly too many times, your Apple ID automatically locks to protect your security and you can't sign in to any Apple services</q> (Apple 2020). To ensure the safety of their users, Apple created this protocol for security purposes, which is a commendable solution.  </p>

<p>	To illustrate even further, the platform Robinhood participated in this same sort of activity. Robinhood, an online stock brokerage platform, restricted their users on making popular investments, such as Gamestop, as the stock market was imploding. Robinhood, much like the previous platforms did, took initiative by restricting users to trade those particular stocks. Jim Angel, a market structure specialist at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, wrote in a <i>Wired</i> article that <q>when Robinhood sees a situation that they know is going to end really badly, they’re going to be worried that if they don’t do something, people are going to come back and say, ‘Why did you let me buy this stock at $300?</q> (Barrett). While users got angry from this limitation, Robinhood used their jurisdiction to prevent stock traders from investing in wages that might detriment them in the future. Robinhood did not allow autonomy for their users to make their own decisions, however, based upon what was happening in the stock market, I believe Robinhood made the correct call in order to protect their users.
</p>

<p>	All these platforms underwent a certain protocol to determine their customer’s usage, as which they thought was their responsibility and choice. Although banks, Apple, and Robinhood all carry different operations, one aspect in common is that they have the ability to secure their users from their data being unveiled to the world. The controversy behind the decision of who should be in charge of one's data still remains, however large platforms should have influence in interest of their users. </p>
