<p class="format"> Our world is dependent and revolves around technology. My passion for this led me to study Information Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Through my studies, I have become immersed in the connection between data, people, and technology and cannot wait to expand more on that knowledge.
</p>

<p class="format">While I coded mostly with Java through high school, my college coding career introduced me to Python. I've enjoyed completing multiple data analyses with Python, while also utilizing Microsoft Excel. My college course work has also led me to structure web pages with HTML, CSS, and Javascript through GitHub. Additionally, I love visually representing data with Adobe InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Canva.</p>

<p class="format">My love for socializing with others is what led me to Information Science in the first place. I like to think of Information Science as the middle-ground of Social Science and Computer Science, my two favorite subjects to learn about. My enthusiasm about these topics is what has lead me to my success in my studies, and eventually, in my career.
