  <p class="format">As an information science student, it is crucial to understand who you are presenting to. As different audiences have specific knowledge and preferences of learning, it is up to us to decide the best way to communicate these findings. </p>

  <p class="format">For example, if I were to present a portfolio to my friends or family, I would want to use a platform that they would understand. Therefore, I would go about this by creating a simple HTML page using CSS and Bootstrap to make it clean and presentable. As the coding behind the scenes would be a bit intensive, it would be irrelevant to those viweing my page. If it were a portfolio, all they would want to see is my projects, resume, contact info, etc., not the actual coding itself. Because I would be presenting to a more casual crowd such as my friends and family, I would not need to do more than a simple HTML page. </p>

  <p class="format">On the other hand, if I were to present my data analysis to a group of coding students, I would want to use Juptyer Notebooks. Say I were completing an analysis using pandas then creating visuals with Seaborn or Vega on Jupyter, I would want to create a clean notebook to communicate my findings. Such as the assignment we completed in the beginning of the semester using markdown to create a beautiful notebook, I would use that same idea. Because the audience would be coding students, they would want to see the code behind the visualizations and analyses. Addiontionally, they would appreciate and understand the code, as it would come off unclear to those who do not know coding.</p>
