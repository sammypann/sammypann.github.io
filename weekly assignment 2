<h1> As an Information Science student, it is to my attention the amount of data that is collected on the daily. While this has become a pressing issue within the ethics of certain apps, organizations, websites, etc., it must also be taken into account the responsibilities these platforms have in order to protect their users. Many platforms have faced lawsuits and backlash from their lack of protection to their users, but on the same token, some platforms take action on behalf of their users, locking them out of said platforms. For example, organizations that have been found to do this include banks, Apple, and Robinhood. Our data is unveiled in the Internet, and these certain operations have come to consensus to put a stop to this for their userâ€™s own good. Whether or not this is ethical, is subjective by case. </h1>
