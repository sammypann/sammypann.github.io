<h1 id="header">Interpretation</h1>


<p class="format"> Based on my findings, it seems as though that the average arrests per precinct out of total arrests is quite low. Therefore, we can assume that if you get stopped by the police in Denver, you most likely will not get arrested. The total amount of arrests are high, but considering how many precincts they are and the average arrests by precincts, the odds of one getting arrested at a traffic stop are slim. Furthermore, this poses the question of "What would increase the average arrest per precinct?" I can only wonder what factors determine this. Is it environmental, social, internal, etc.? For example, would the amount of arrests be higher during the holidays because people are more prone to drink and drive? If I were to continue this research, I would love to dive into data about other months in this dataset and interpret those results.   </p>
