<p>The data set used for assignment 7 can be found <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%201-d&geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F03p1r4">here.</a></p>

<p>In Version 2, I changed the colors in the chart and added a title to describe what the data was. I also changed it from a bar chart to a horizontal bar chart so it is easier to read. </p>

<p>In Version 3, I added tooltips so that when you hover each bar, you can see exactly what the data is communicating on each time slot. </p>
