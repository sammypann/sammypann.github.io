<h1> Who's Responsible? </h1>

<p>	The Bachelor franchise can be considered as one of the biggest television goldmines in society today. As the popularity of the Bachelor/Bachelorette continues to rise, many viewers pose questions about the television program and what really determines the winner. Though using a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/brianbgonz/the-bachelorette-contestants#__sid=js0/">dataset</a> on Kaggle, I was able to determine that all but one of the bachelorette winners was in his late 20s. While this could be a coincidence, I believe there is truth to it. Reasons for this phenomenon could include the maturity of adult males, divorce risk, and the benefit of marrying in the late 20s. 
  </p> 

<p>	Out of the eleven winners in the dataset, ten of them were aged in their late 20s, as seen in the graphic below. </p>

<p>	 One of the correlations for this occurrence could be the fact that the adult male brain does not fully mature until their mid-twenties. With this, it can be assumed that males in their early twenties may not be mature enough for marriage, and that maturity affects their ability to have a serious relationship like seen on the Bachelor. Dr. Sandra Aamodt, a neuroscientist and science writer, reported in a <i>Man of the Hour</i> <a href="http://www.manofthehourmag.com/culture/the-maturity-of-young-men">magazine article</a> that “men do not reach full maturity until age 25. At this age, brains fully develop and can make more mature, well-thought out life decisions” (Melnyk 2018). The research that Dr. Aamodt presented in that article offers a reasonable explanation for why younger candidates in the show did not make it to the final round, or make it to a proposal. To reach life decisions at a young age might not create the best outcome, hence why older contestants had more success in the Bachelor.

<p>	To illustrate even further, the platform Robinhood participated in this same sort of activity. Robinhood, an online stock brokerage platform, restricted their users on making popular investments, such as Gamestop, as the stock market was imploding. Robinhood, much like the previous platforms did, took initiative by restricting users to trade those particular stocks. Jim Angel, a market structure specialist at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, wrote in a <i>Wired</i> article that <q>when Robinhood sees a situation that they know is going to end really badly, they’re going to be worried that if they don’t do something, people are going to come back and say, ‘Why did you let me buy this stock at $300?</q> (Barrett). While users got angry from this limitation, Robinhood used their jurisdiction to prevent stock traders from investing in wages that might detriment them in the future. Robinhood did not allow autonomy for their users to make their own decisions, however, based upon what was happening in the stock market, I believe Robinhood made the correct call in order to protect their users.
</p>

<p>	All these platforms underwent a certain protocol to determine their customer’s usage, as which they thought was their responsibility and choice. Although banks, Apple, and Robinhood all carry different operations, one aspect in common is that they have the ability to secure their users from their data being unveiled to the world. The controversy behind the decision of who should be in charge of one's data still remains, however large platforms should have influence in interest of their users. </p>
