<p class="format"> In my redesign, I used features such as the Navbar, Carousal, and Accordian. Because I wanted to carry that simplistic look from the other sites I was inspired by, I thought these features were the perfect way to do so. By using the Navbar to link to my different pages, it exhibits a cleaner look, rather than having buttons which I had on my previous site. The use of the Carousal on the home page allows for certain pictures to be displayed that give insight to my life. The Accordian feature was used for my contact page to arrange my contact information in a more clear, concise way.
